This dataset contains information about sponsored search conversion dataset. It contains information about the product related advertisements a user has clicked and possibly converted (i.e. sale has occurred).  The products were shown to the user, once the user has expressed his/her intent via a search query. This datasets provides a platform to analyze new set of applications in the world of conversion modeling for online search advertising.

Data description

This dataset represents a sample of 90 days of Criteo live traffic data. Each line corresponds to one click (product related advertisement) that was displayed to a user. For each advertisement, we have detailed information about the product. Further, we also provide information on whether the click led to a conversion, amount of conversion and the time between the click and the conversion.  Data has been sub-sampled and anonymized so as not to disclose proprietary elements.

Delimited: \t (tab separated)

Missing Value Indicator: -1 for all other fields. 0 indicates missing for field click_timestamp

Outcome/Labels

Sale : Indicates 1 if conversion occurred and 0 if not).
SalesAmountInEuro : Indicates the revenue obtained when a conversion took place. This might be different from product-price, due to attribution issues. It is -1, when no conversion took place.
Time_delay_for_conversion : This indicates the time between click and conversion. It is -1, when no conversion took place.
